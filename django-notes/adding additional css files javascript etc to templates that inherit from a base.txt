If you want to add things like additional stylesheets simply create a block INSIDE the header portion of the template which your page

inherits from. E.G if a page 'extends' base.html then put this code INSIDE the header portion:

   {% block extrahead %}{% endblock %}
   </head> (this is where header ends)

Then in the template you are using simply put:

   {%load static}

after the 'extends' statement and then add something like this near top:

    {% block extrahead %}
    <link href="{%static 'posts/css/style2.css' %}" rel="stylesheet" %}>}
    {% endblock %}

The new css files should ALSO now be loaded.
