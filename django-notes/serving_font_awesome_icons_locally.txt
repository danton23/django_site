(NOTE - before everything else check that you are using the correct version/files version)

In order to do this you need to follow several steps.

First in the HTML file on which the icons will appear (or on the one which it inherits from) you need to link to the stylesheet

Download the 'all.css' file or the 'fontawesome.min.css' file from their website and link to this as a stylesheet.

(note - It seems that if you link to the fontawesome.css file as stylesheet you DONT need to add the webfont folder - Note)

In order for this to work (if you link to the all.css files or the fontawesome.min.css, however, you need to link to the 

Font files in the path specified in the file under the @font-face property (will probably start with ../) which means first UP

One level - so need to put the webfonts folder (downloadable from FA website) on level UP from where css file is contained 

ANOTHER error which might be shown in DEV tools is that a certain file - typically fa-solid-900.woff 1 and 2 - are missing

If so just download these files and add into the webfonts folder manually (a good source seems to be this one - 

https://www.torproject.org/static/fonts/fontawesome/webfonts/   )

After these steps (either adding just the fontawesome.css or trying one of the other two AND adding the webfonts folder into appropriate place

You should be able to add <i> elements using fa, fas etc classes into html and style them (typical syntax <i class = "fa fa-pencil"

or fas fa-pencil)

(NOTE: in general if you have problem with styling etc try running python manage.py collect static and clearing browser cache)
