To Serve Static Files on developement Server - first make sure the 'app' (i.e Polls Posts etc) is listed in installed apps 
then create a static folder inside the main folder of the app inside THIS create a file with the name of app eg if app is called Customers stucture
will equal Customers/static/Customer then put static files inside of this 

In settings.py make sure these lines are there
 


 STATICFILES_DIRS = (
     os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static"),
  )

  STATIC_URL = '/static/'

then in the header (or at top somewhere) put this line:

{% load static %}

whenever you want to load a static file now (provided you have put in in directory my_app/static/my_app) 
simply put e.g <img src="{%static 'my_app/css/styles.css'%}"> (note here we only put the part of the path AFTER static folder located in the app)
should then load (P.S the SINGLE QUOTES in line of code above seem to be important)
