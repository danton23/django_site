In order to use elements of one page (i.e header stylesheets nav bars footers and anything else) on another
put {%extends 'index.html'%} for example

In order to make different elements customisable you can use block tags
e.g {%block title%} Page Tite {%endblock%}
if this was in index.html and you created another template which extended this page then you can customsie the 
content by putting {%block title%} Other Title {%endblock%} for example
if you DONT want certain elements appearing by default then put them inside something like a content block 
this wont show up when page is 'extended' 
(eg if only wanted nav bar from main page to be 'extended' onto others put everything else in a content block 
and then put all content in 'extended' pages into content blocks of their own - this will 'override' original cotnent)
