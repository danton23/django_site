Unless you are providing 'hard-coded' static paths to media files like images you need to set Django up so it knows where to store and find image 
files and the like which are created dynamically by users/admin (through creation of 'objects')

In order to get this working you first need to add these lines to the settings.py file for your project:

    BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
    PROJECT_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
Then, lower down, add these lines:
  
    MEDIA_URL = '/media/'
    MEDIA_ROOT =  os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'media')

(Also if you are having problems with serving static files - which should be got up and running BEFORE these steps - then check you also have 
something like the following lines somewhere in the file):

   STATIC_URL = '/static/'
   STATICFILES_DIRS = (
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "static"),)

   STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(PROJECT_DIR, 'static') 

Finally, in order to let your models know where to store media when it is created you should add something like this to the models.py file for 
the model in question for fields which will enable the user to upload images etc:

   image= models.ImageField(null=True,blank=True, upload_to="images/")

   
The last line gives the path to a subfolder - which will be created inside the media folder already defined in settings.py - where the newly
added image (or other media - I think!) can be stored.
