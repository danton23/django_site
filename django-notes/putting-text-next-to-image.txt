In order to make sure that text appears NEXT to image first put them both inside the same DIV (if you have problems with content overflowing

EITHER adjust dimensions of div OR set overflow:hidden (this will truncate content, though, if it is too big).

Next set the image to float:right or float:left (or margin: 0 auto etc to put in center of page) 

Then add this property to the text elem (inside the same div as the image) which you want to appear NEXT to it:
       
    display:block;
 
Finally you can justify the text to make it look better by adding this property:

    text-align:justify;
